## Install
### Clone the project

Firstable, you need to clone the project on your computer with 

    git clone 

### With Docker

You can override the docker-compose configuration with your own by renaming docker-compose.override.yml.dist by docker-compose.override.yml
and put your own ports and ip addresses to be used by docker.

#### Build images

    cd your/project/root
    make build
    
#### Run images

    cd your/project/root
    make up
    
#### Stop images

    cd your/project/root
    make down
    
#### Reload images

    cd your/project/root
    make reload
    
#### Use console in image
    
    docker ps
    
It returns:  
    
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                NAMES
    909421ecf6b5        nginx                   "nginx"                  12 seconds ago      Up 10 seconds       443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp        nginx_1
    04e7d84fd3a8        php                     "docker-php-entrypoi…"   13 seconds ago      Up 11 seconds       0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp               php_1
    ee6967df7afb        mysql:5.7               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   14 seconds ago      Up 12 seconds       33060/tcp, 0.0.0.0:13306->3306/tcp   db_1

Then, in this example, to use project's console:

    docker exec -ti 04e /bin/bash

### Without Docker

Type: 

    make install
   
## Commands
### JWT SSH keys generation

    make jwt-keys
    
Then you have to open reading rights on private.pem key, so:

    cd config/jwt
    sudo chmod 644 private.pem

### User creation

Type:

    make user-create
    
To promote a user to admin

    php bin/console fos:user:promote username ROLE_ADMIN

## Use
### With Docker

Firstable, up the project's images with

    make up
    
or

    make reload

Then, in your browser, go to localhost:8080 or set a virtual host.

### Without Docker

In your browser, go to path_to_local_project/public/ or set a virtual host.

### Token generation

The token is generated by JWT (with Lexik JWT Authentication Bundle). 
To generate it, go in your HTTP Client and go to the POST route /api/login_check with header 

    Content-Type: application/json
    
and, in json body
    
    {
        "username": "user",
        "password": "pw" 
    }
    
or with curl:

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost/api/login_check -d '{"username":"user","password":"pw"}'

### Token use

Put a HTTP header 
    
    Authorization: Bearer {Token}
